# Kersha: Live Data (Basic)

## Overview
This Shiny app demonstrates real-time temperature readings in Antarctica. It uses PyShiny to create an interactive web application that displays the current temperature and timestamp. The app updates the data periodically to provide live insights.

## Features
- **Current Temperature**: Displays the current temperature with real-time updates.
- **Current Date and Time**: Shows the current date and time, updating in real-time.
- **Links**: Provides useful links to the GitHub source, GitHub app, and PyShiny documentation.

## Installation Requirements
To run this app, you need the following Python packages:
- `shiny`
- `shiny-express`
- `faicons`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them using `pip`:
```sh
pip install shiny shiny-express faicons matplotlib

* Types of Imports
## Standard Library Imports:

These are built-in modules that come with Python. For example:

import random
from datetime import datetime

## Third-Party Library Imports:

These are additional libraries you install via pip. For example:


from shiny.express import ui
from faicons import icon_svg
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Organize Imports:

Keep standard library imports at the top, followed by third-party imports, and then your own modules.

Example:

python
import random
from datetime import datetime

from shiny.express import ui
from faicons import icon_svg
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Use Aliases:

For readability and convenience, use aliases for long module names.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Import Only What You Need:

## Instead of importing the entire module, import only the functions or classes you need.

from shiny import reactive, render

## Avoid Circular Imports:

Be cautious of importing modules that import each other, as this can lead to errors.
